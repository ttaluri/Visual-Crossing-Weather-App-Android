#### This app displays a variety of weather data for a specified location – current weather, hourly forecast, and daily forecast (15 days). 
#### The app is made up of 2 activities – the home weather screen and the daily forecast screen. 
#### The weather data comes from the Visual Crossing Weather API. 
#### The app uses the user’s device location to determine the location to use for the weather content.
#### MainActivity uses a Gradient background (as do the entries in the daily forecast) that varies from blue to green to red, depending upon the temperature. 
#### MainActivity displays the hourly forecast in a horizontal RecyclerView and in a temperature chart showing the day’s temperature by hour.
